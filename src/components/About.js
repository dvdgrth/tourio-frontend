        MyLinkYourLink is a search engine which outputs links submitted by
        users. When submitting links we ask you to describe them and describe
        the overall theme and intend of the new entry. This way others can
        decide if it sounds interesting to them. Also, they are guided by your
        descriptions and may appreciate the added context and personal approach.

        Existing search engines are amazing - for certain tasks, like getting
        links to big sites. For other tasks they are outright terrible or even
        manipulative, like when they spit out SEO optimized junk sites or ad
        links. The web is full of great sites which currently just aren't found
        by your search.

        Another related problem is the continuing stupidity of computers and
        their inability to understand what we are really looking for. We may
        have a better chance of finding what we want by relying not on
        algorithms but on other people.
