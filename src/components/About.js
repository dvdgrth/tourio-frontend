        MyLinkYourLink is a search engine which returns links submitted by
        users. When submitting links we ask you to describe them and describe
        the overall theme and intend of the new entry. This way others can
        decide if it sounds interesting to them. And if they have a look at your
        links, they are guided by your descriptions and may appreciate the added
        context and personal approach.

        Existing search engines are amazing - for certain tasks, like getting
        links to big sites. For other tasks they are outright terrible or even
        manipulative, like when they spit out SEO optimized junk sites or
        advertising links. The web is full of great sites which currently just
        aren't found by your typical search engine or aren't ranked properly.

        Another related problem is the continuing stupidity of computers and
        their inability to understand what we are really looking for. We may
        have a better chance of finding what we want by relying not on
        algorithms but on other people. Wouldn't we benefit if instead of the
        typical data dump we got curated links from a real person - maybe an
        expert on the topic, maybe not - but always with a different personal
        perspective to it.

        Ever done a deep googleing session on a topic? Ever wondered if somebody
        else has already searched the exact same thing? There should be some way
        to "save and share" a search session, meaning the best (most helpful,
        interesting etc.) links one can find should be shareable. This way we
        would skip or shorten the initial phase of crambling and often suffering
        through the mud in search for the nuggets. If we could start with the
        best finds of somebody else, we probably would often still want to
        search for ourselves but the suggestions could give us valuable starting
        point for our own search or links we would not have been able to find on
        our own.

        We should remember the adventerous, elegant spirit of the early web: An
        ocean of ressources, of sites, of space stations if you will - connected
        by links, by waterways, by rocket routes. A "web" is woven, a new world
        is build - cyberspace: the new frontier. Much of the magic was lost or
        was never there to begin with but the basic idea of the internet (sites
        connceted by links) is very much alive and well and isn't going
        anywhere. Let's bring the magic back. Let's build beautiful tours
        through the web. Let's create Hitchhikers Guides to the world wide web,
        with treasure maps to our favorite sites.

        MyLinkYourLink is not a direct competitor to existing search engines.
        Rather, it is a complementary form of search powered by you and me.
